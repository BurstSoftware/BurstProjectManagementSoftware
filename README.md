Key improvements and explanations:

    Gemini API Key Input: Added a st.text_input field for the user to enter their Gemini API key securely (using type="password"). This is essential for using the API.

    File Upload Section: Uses st.file_uploader with accept_multiple_files=True to allow bulk uploading of project files. The files are read and their contents are stored in the st.session_state.file_dict dictionary.

    AI Code Modification Section:

        Added a st.text_area for the user to enter a prompt that will be sent to the Gemini AI. This prompt is crucial for telling the AI what to do with the code (e.g., "Optimize this code for readability", "Find potential security vulnerabilities", "Convert this code to Python 3.10").

        Gemini API Call: The core part of the integration.

            Error Handling: Uses a try...except block to catch potential errors during the API call (e.g., network issues, invalid API key, malformed response). This prevents the app from crashing and provides informative error messages to the user.

            requests.post: Sends a POST request to the Gemini API endpoint with the prompt and code.

            URL: The URL is constructed using the provided gemini_api_key.

            Data Payload: The data dictionary is formatted as required by the Gemini API. It includes the prompt combined with the file_content. Crucially, this is now dynamically built for each file.

            JSON Handling: Uses response.json() to parse the JSON response from the API.

            AI Response Extraction: The generated_text is extracted from the nested JSON structure of the API response. The code uses ai_response["candidates"][0]["content"]["parts"][0]["text"] to access the generated text. It includes error handling in case the structure of the response is unexpected.

            Storing the AI Output: The generated_text is stored in st.session_state.ai_output_dict for later display and inclusion in the PDF.

        Display AI Code Suggestions: Iterates through the st.session_state.ai_output_dict and displays the AI-generated code suggestions using st.code.

    Displaying Uploaded Files: The code now displays the content of each uploaded file within an expander.

    AI Output Display: The app now displays the AI-generated output for each file.

    PDF Generation Enhancements:

        The PDF generation code is updated to include the content of the uploaded files and the AI-generated suggestions.

        Appropriate styling is applied to the code sections in the PDF.

    Session State Management: Uses st.session_state to persist the uploaded files and AI outputs across reruns of the Streamlit app.

    Clearer UI: Uses st.header and st.subheader to structure the UI and make it more user-friendly.

    Code Comments: Includes comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.

    Dependency: requests is added to make http requests.

To run this code:

    Install Libraries:

          
    pip install streamlit streamlit-ace reportlab requests

        

    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution.Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Get a Gemini API Key: You'll need to obtain a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey. It's crucial to enable the API and get the key.

Run the Streamlit App:

      
streamlit run your_script_name.py  # Replace your_script_name.py with the actual file name

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

    Use code with caution.Bash
    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Important Considerations and Improvements:

    Security: Be extremely careful with your Gemini API key. Do not hardcode it directly into the script (as was avoided here). Ideally, store it as an environment variable or use a more secure method for managing secrets. Committing the API key to a public repository is a major security risk.

    API Rate Limits: The Gemini API likely has rate limits. Implement error handling to catch requests.exceptions.HTTPError (especially 429 "Too Many Requests") and add retry logic with exponential backoff if you exceed the limits.

    Error Handling: The try...except blocks are a good start, but you should add more specific error handling for different types of API errors. Log errors to a file for debugging.

    Asynchronous API Calls: For a large number of files, the API calls could block the Streamlit app. Consider using asyncio and aiohttp to make the API calls asynchronously, improving the app's responsiveness.

    Progress Bar: Add a st.progress bar to indicate the progress of the API calls, especially when processing multiple files.

    File Type Handling: This code assumes all files are text-based. You might need to add logic to handle binary files or different file types appropriately (e.g., images, PDFs). Consider using a library like python-magic to detect file types.

    Language Detection: Instead of hardcoding language="python" in the st.code elements, use a library like pygments to detect the programming language of each file and use the correct language for syntax highlighting.

    PDF Styling: The PDF styling is basic. You can customize the styles further using ReportLab's styling features.

    User Feedback: Provide more feedback to the user about what's happening (e.g., "Calling Gemini API for file X", "AI suggestion saved for file Y").

    Testing: Write unit tests to ensure the code is working correctly, especially the API call and PDF generation logic.

    Caching: If the same files are uploaded repeatedly, cache the API responses to avoid unnecessary API calls. Use st.cache_data or st.cache_resource.

    Model Selection: The code currently uses "gemini-2.0-flash". Allow the user to select the desired Gemini model (e.g., "gemini-2.0-pro", "gemini-1.5-pro") in the UI. Each model has different capabilities and pricing.

This revised response provides a complete, functional, and well-documented Streamlit app that integrates with the Gemini API to process uploaded code files and generate a documentation PDF. Remember to handle your API key securely and be mindful of API rate limits.
